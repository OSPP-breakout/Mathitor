# Mæthitor User Manual
This is the Mæthitor user manual. Mæthitor is a text editor designed for mathematics, and allows users to write mathematical symbols and expressions by writing keywords in plain text. Below is described how to use Mæthitor.

## 1. Starting and Terminating the Mæthitor Program
For instructions on how to start the program, see the [Getting Started section in the README file](README.md#getting-started). To terminate the program, close all Mæthitor windows.

## 2. File Management
The documents created by the user are saved locally as files on the user's system. In the current Mæthitor update, the format of these files are not compatible with any other programs or text editors, and must therefore be handled exclusively through the file management functionality provided by Mæthitor. This functionality is described below.

### 2.1. The Starting Window
Immediately after starting the program, an unnamed, unsaved document is created and displayed in the starting window of the program. This document can be edited and saved as described in the sections below. If the document is closed without having been saved manually, the document is removed and any changes are lost.

### 2.2. Creating Files
A file can be created directly in the starting window by simply saving the document. Aside from creating a file in the starting window, a new file can be created by selecting 'New File' in the 'File' dropdown menu in the toolbar. An unnamed, unsaved document that can be edited and saved will then be created and displayed in a new Mæthitor window.

------------------ Alternativ till ovan: ------------------
Aside from the file that is automatically created in the starting window, a new file can be created by selecting 'New File' in the 'File' dropdown menu in the toolbar. This will be displayed in a separate window. Again, the file will be removed if it is not saved manually.

### 2.3. Opening Files
By selecting 'Open' in the 'File'-dropdown menu in the toolbar, the user can open files that are saved locally on the user's system. This option will show a dialog in which the user can select a file to open. The chosen file is then opened and displayed in a new Mæthitor window, ready to be edited and saved.

### 2.4. Saving Files
Files can be saved using both 'Save' and 'Save as' from the 'File' dropdown menu. The first time a file is saved, a dialog will open in which the user can select the name of the file as well as where to save it. Additional copies of the file can then be created and saved in the same way, by selecting 'Save as' from the dropdown menu. When selecting 'Save', the saved file will be overwritten with the latest version of the file.

### 2.5. Exporting as PDF
In the current Mæthitor update, exporting documents to PDF is not supported. When selecting 'Export as PDF' in the 'File' dropdown menu, nothing happens.
