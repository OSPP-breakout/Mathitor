# Mæthitor User Manual
This is the Mæthitor user manual. Mæthitor is a text editor designed for mathematics, and allows users to write mathematical symbols and expressions by writing key words in plain text. Below is described how to use Mæthitor.

## 1. Starting and Terminating the Mæthitor Program
For instructions on how to start the program, see the [Getting Started section in the README file](README.md#getting-started). To terminate the program, close all Mæthitor windows.

## 2. File Management
The documents created by the user are saved locally as files on the user's system. In the current Mæthitor update, the format of these files are not compatible with any other programs or text editors, and must therefore be handled exclusively through the file management functionality provided by Mæthitor. This functionality is described below.

### 2.1. The Starting Window
Immediately after starting the program, an unnamed, unsaved document is created and displayed in the starting window of the program. This document can be edited and saved as described in the sections below. If the document is closed without having been saved manually, the document is removed and any changes are lost.
